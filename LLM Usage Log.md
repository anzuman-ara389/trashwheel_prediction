# LLM Usage Log
I used ChatGPT during this project mainly as a support tool when I got stuck. For example, I asked for clarification about a few errors and for help understanding how to structure the Streamlit interface. I also used it to check that my feature engineering steps made sense and to get explanations of certain concepts in cleaner language.

All coding decisions, testing, analysis, and model selection were done by me after 
reviewing and understanding the suggestions. The assistant guided my thinking at 
several points, but the final implementation and choices throughout the project 
were my own.
